## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ About Me:
I'm a Computer Science student @ Oregon State University with hands-on experience across desktop applications, mobile game development, and full-stack web applications. My professional background includes developing robust, modular codebases in React for frontend interfaces and Flask for backend services. Recently, I've delved into mobile game development, leveraging Swift and SpriteKit for engaging game mechanics. My technical expertise includes building desktop applications in C++, creating full-stack web applications with React and TypeScript, and developing backend services with Next.js and Hono.

Currently, Iâ€™m a College Software Developer at Hyel Inc., where Iâ€™m gaining valuable industry experience building a mobile game for their platform. Alongside, Iâ€™m pursuing the AWS Solutions Architect certification to deepen my knowledge of cloud and DevOps practices, including containerization with Docker, orchestration with Kubernetes, and scalable architecture design.

*"True growth comes from a willingness to learn and the humility to recognize thereâ€™s always more to discover."*
